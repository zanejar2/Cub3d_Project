Cub3d is an inspiring team project that embodies the power of collaboration and collective effort. In this remarkable endeavor, I had the honor to work alongside Zenajr2, my esteemed teammate. Together, we embarked on a journey of creativity, combining our skills and expertise to write these lines of code.
Cub3d is an innovative project that pushes the boundaries of 3D visualization. Through our lines of code, we have created a captivating world where users can explore and interact with a virtual environment. Our goal was to deliver an immersive and visually stunning experience that would captivate and engage users.
this project is a captivating 3D game, created entirely from scratch using the C programming language. We embraced the challenge of building this game from the ground up, crafting every aspect of it with precision and care. The game showcases an impressive old technology called raycasting, which gives a visually stunning 3D effect that immerses players in a unique gaming experience.
To accomplish this, we utilized an old graphic library called mini-libx. With its capabilities and our dedication, we were able to push the boundaries of what can be achieved using this technology. The result is a visually appealing game that captures the essence of the 3D world we set out to create.
